## When this policy applies

This Privacy Policy applies to the following software offered by me (collectively, the "Services"):

- Form Octopus
- Tabs Aside

This Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other entities, including those that may be linked from the Services.

## No information is collected

I do not collect any data of any kind through my Services unless you choose to provide that information by contacting me via:

- Email ([blueputty [at] gmail.com](mailto:blueputty01@gmail.com))
- Feedback forms

Form Octopus does not store data of any kind. It reads and writes the data to and from the Google Forms and the Google Spreadsheets it has been linked to.

Tabs Aside reads and writes data via the [chrome.storage.sync](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/) API that Google's Chrome browser provides. Feel free to read more about it on the developer reference. In essence, the tabs that Tabs Aside saves are stored with a user's Google Chrome profile, and cannot be accessed by anyone who does not have access to a user's login information.

## Changes to this privacy policy

Though I will make my best efforts to notify you, I reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. The date of the last change is indicated at the top of the page. Your continued use of the Services after an update to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such a revised Privacy Policy.

## Contact

Questions about this Privacy Policy or the Services may be directed towards [blueputty [at] gmail.com](mailto:blueputty01@gmail.com).
